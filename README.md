# Video-Game-Sales-1980-2020
Taking a look at video game sales from 1980-2020 to determine highest sales by region, platform, and game. 

In continuing my practice with Pandas, I looked at data related to video games sales. This dataset is only from 1980-2020, so it's not up to date with current numbers. Regardless, it was a facinating dataset to explore. I used [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandshaw2001/video-game-sales/data) from Kaggle. 

###Top 5 Games Globally 
1. Wii Sports
2. Super Mario Bros.
3. Mario Kart Wii
4. Wii Sports Resort
5. Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue

###Top 5 Games in Japan
1. Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue
2. Pokemon Gold/Pokemon Silver
3. Super Mario Bros.
4. New Super Mario Bros.
5. Pokemon Diamond/Pokemon Silver

I listed global and Japan because NA and EU had such similar sales, while Japan varied quite a bit. Wii Sports across the board was ranked first, except in Japan. This is because in NA and EU, Wii Sports was bundled with the purchase of a Wii, while it wasn't in Japan. Wii Sports didn't even make the top 20 for Japan. Regardless, Nintendo overwhelmingly had the highest sales across the board. Likely the way they market their games, appealing towards families and children. As well as creating games for all skill levels across the board.
